## Modelling the power spectral density

We use [`SingleBendingPowerLaw`](@ref) and [`DoubleBendingPowerLaw`](@ref) to model the power spectral density of the random process generating the time series data.

```@example modelling
using Plots
using Pioran
ùìü1 = SingleBendingPowerLaw(1., .1, 3.4)
ùìü2 = SingleBendingPowerLaw(.4, 1e-2, 3.)
ùìü3 = SingleBendingPowerLaw(.1, 3., 2.4)
ùìü1d = DoubleBendingPowerLaw(1.2,1e-3,2.4,1.1,4.2)
ùìü2d = DoubleBendingPowerLaw(0.2,1e-2,1.3,24.3,3.1)
ùìü3d = DoubleBendingPowerLaw(0.5,1e-3,2.1,91.2,4.9)
f = 10 .^ range(-4, stop=3, length=1000)
l = @layout [a b]
p1 =  plot(f,[ùìü1(f),ùìü2(f),ùìü3(f)],xlabel="Frequency (day^-1)",ylabel="Power Spectral Density",legend=false,framestyle = :box,xscale=:log10,yscale=:log10,ylims=(1e-15,1e1),lw=2)
p2 =  plot(f,[ùìü1d(f),ùìü2d(f),ùìü3d(f)],xlabel="Frequency (day^-1)",legend=false,framestyle = :box,xscale=:log10,yscale=:log10,ylims=(1e-15,1e1),lw=2)
plot(p1,p2,layout=l,size=(700,300),grid=false,left_margin=2Plots.mm,bottom_margin=20Plots.px,title=["Single bending power-law" "Double bending power-law"])
```

## Approximating the power spectral density

To obtain the covariance function, we approximate the power spectral density by a sum of basis functions $\psi(f)$. At the moment, we use either of the following basis functions:

```math
\begin{align}\begin{split}
\psi_4(f) = \frac{1}{1+f^4}\\
\psi_6(f) = \frac{1}{1+f^6}
\end{split}
\end{align}
```
These basis functions have analytical Fourier transforms and are used to approximate the covariance function. The Fourier transform of the basis functions are given by

```math
\begin{align}\begin{split}
\phi_4(\tau) &= \exp\left(-\pi\sqrt{2}\tau\right) \left(\cos\left(\pi\sqrt{2}\tau\right)+\sin\left(\pi\sqrt{2}\tau\right)\right)\\
\phi_6(\tau) &=\pi/3\exp{\left(-2\pi \tau\right)}+\exp{\left(-\pi\tau\right)}\left(\pi/3\cos\left(\pi\sqrt{3}\tau\right)+\pi/\sqrt{3}\sin\left(\pi\sqrt{3}\tau\right)\right)\end{split}
\end{align}
```

We need to specify the frequency range `f0` and `fM` over which the approximation is performed. We also need to specify the number of basis functions `J` to use. Once this is done the frequency grid is defined as:

```math
f_j=f_\mathrm{start}\left({f_\mathrm{stop}}/{f_\mathrm{start}}\right)^{j/(J-1)}
```

The approximation of the power spectral density is then given by

```math
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{P}(f)\simeq \tilde{\mathcal{P}}(f)&=  \sum\limits_{j=0}^{J-1} a_j \psi(f/f_j)\\
    \mathcal{R}(\tau)\simeq \tilde{\mathcal{R}}(\tau)&= \sum\limits_{j=0}^{J-1} a_j f_j \phi(\tau f_j)
\end{align}
```

Adding the constraint that the approximation and the true power spectrum must be equal on the grid of frequencies gives a linear system of $J$ equations for the coefficients $a_j$. This system can be written with a Toeplitz matrix $B$  and a vector $\boldsymbol{a}$ as:

```math
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{p} = \boldsymbol{a} B \quad \text{where } B_{ij}=\psi(f_i/f_j) \text{ and } p_j = \mathcal{P}(f_j)
\end{align}
```

The values of $p_j$" are divided by $p_0$ so that the values of $a_j$ are not too high, what we are interested in is the amplitude of the covariance function which gives the variance of the process - the integral of the power spectrum.

Visually, the approximation can be seen as follows:
```@example modelling
f0, fM = 1e-3, 1e3
ùìü = SingleBendingPowerLaw(.4, 1e-1, 3.)
f = 10 .^ range(-3, stop=3, length=1000)
psd_approx = Pioran.approximated_psd(f, ùìü, f0, fM, n_components=20,basis_function="SHO",individual=true)

plot(f,ùìü(f)/ùìü(f0),xscale=:log10,yscale=:log10,label="True PSD",xlabel="Frequency (day^-1)",ylabel="Power Spectral Density",lw=2,framestyle = :box,grid=false)
plot!(f,sum(psd_approx,dims=2),label="Approximated PSD",lw=2)
plot!(f,psd_approx,label=nothing,color=:black,alpha=.5,ylims=(1e-15,1e1),ls=:dot)
```

### Limitations and diagnostics for the approximation

!!! warning "Limitations of the approximation"
    This approximation is limited by the steepness of the basis functions, this means that if the power spectrum you want to approximate is steeper than the basis functions, the approximation may fail. Equivalently, the basis functions are flat at low frequencies, modelling a rising power spectrum at low frequencies can also be difficult.

In order to check the quality of the approximation, we can compute the residuals and ratios between the true and approximated power spectrum. First, we need to define the range of allowed values for each parameter to check. As we adopt a Bayesian workflow, one can use the prior distribution to define the range of allowed values for each parameter. This can be done as follows:

```@example modelling
using Distributions
using Random
rng = MersenneTwister(1234)

min_f_b, max_f_b = 1e-3, 1e3
function prior_transform(cube)
    Œ±‚ÇÅ = quantile(Uniform(0.0, 1.25), cube[1])
    f‚ÇÅ = quantile(LogUniform(min_f_b, max_f_b), cube[2])
    Œ±‚ÇÇ = quantile(Uniform(Œ±‚ÇÅ, 4.0), cube[3])
    variance = quantile(LogNormal(-1,2), cube[4])
    return [Œ±‚ÇÅ, f‚ÇÅ, Œ±‚ÇÇ, variance]
end

P = 2000
unif = rand(rng, 4, P)
priors = mapreduce(permutedims, hcat, [prior_transform(unif[:, i]) for i in 1:P]')
l = @layout [a b ; c d]
p1 = histogram(priors[1,:],xlabel="Œ±‚ÇÅ")
bins = 10.0 .^LinRange( log10(minimum(priors[2,:])),log10(quantile(priors[2,:],.99)),30)
p2 = histogram(priors[2,:],bins=bins,xaxis=(:log10,(bins[1],bins[end])),xlabel="f‚ÇÅ")
p3 = histogram(priors[3,:],xlabel="Œ±‚ÇÇ")
bins = 10.0 .^LinRange( log10(minimum(priors[4,:])),log10(quantile(priors[4,:],1)),30)
p4 = histogram(priors[4,:],xlabel="variance",bins=bins,xaxis=(:log10,(bins[1],bins[end])))
plot(p1,p2,p3,p4,layout=l,size=(700,300),grid=false,left_margin=2Plots.mm,bottom_margin=20Plots.px,legend=false)
```

We can then use the function [`run_diagnostics`](@ref) to assess the quality of the approximation.
The first argument is an array containing the parameters of the power spectral density, the second argument is the variance of the process. `f_min` and `f_max` are the minimum and maximum frequencies of the time series, this is to show the window of observed frequencies in the plots.

```@example modelling
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!(type = "png")
f_min, f_max = 1e-3 * 5, 1e3 / 5
figs = run_diagnostics(priors[1:3, :], priors[4, :], f0, fM, SingleBendingPowerLaw, f_min,f_max, n_components=20, basis_function="SHO")
```
The following plots are produced:
The mean of the residuals and ratios as a function of frequency.
```@example modelling
figs[1]# hide
```

The quantiles of the residuals and ratios as a function of frequency.
```@example modelling
figs[2]# hide
```
The distribution of the mean, median and maximum values of the frequency-averaged residuals and ratios.
```@example modelling
figs[3] # hide
```

Using these three diagnostics we can see that a `SingleBendingPowerLaw` with the chosen prior distributions can be well approximated with 20 SHO basis functions.


## Building the Gaussian process

Now that we have checked that approximation hold for our choice of priors we can build the Gaussian process.

### Building the covariance function

The covariance function using the approximation of the power spectral density is obtained using the function [`approx`](@ref). We need to specify the frequency range `f0` and `fM` over which the approximation is performed, the number of basis functions `J` to use, and the variance of the process - integral of the power spectrum. One can also give the type of basis function to use, the default is `SHO` which corresponds to the basis function $\psi_4$, `DRWCelerite` corresponds to $\psi_6$.

```@example modelling
ùìü = SingleBendingPowerLaw(.4, 1e-1, 3.)

variance = 2.2
ùì° = approx(ùìü, f0, fM, 20, variance, basis_function="SHO")
```

### Building the Gaussian process

The Gaussian process is built using the type [`ScalableGP`](@ref). If the mean of the process $\mu$ is known, it can be given as a first argument. Otherwise, the mean is assumed to be zero.

```@example modelling
Œº = 1.3
f = ScalableGP(Œº, ùì°)
```
At the moment, the GP does not include the measurement variance `œÉ¬≤` and the time values `t`. This is done in the next step.
```@example modelling
using DelimitedFiles # hide
A = readdlm("data/simu.txt",comments=true) # hide
t, y, yerr = A[:,1], A[:,2], A[:,3] # hide
œÉ¬≤ = yerr .^ 2
fx = f(t, œÉ¬≤)
```
The log-likelihood of the Gaussian process given the data `y` can be computed using the function `logpdf` from the `Distributions` package.
```@example modelling
logpdf(fx, y)
```
